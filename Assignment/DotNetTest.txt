Q1: Replace each array element by its corresponding rank
  Given an array of distinct integers, replace each array element by its corresponding rank in the array.

The minimum array element has the rank 1; the second minimum element has a rank of 2, and so onâ€¦ For example,

Input:  { 10, 8, 15, 12, 6, 20, 1 } 
Output: { 4, 3, 6, 5, 2, 7, 1 }


Q2: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 
Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


Q3:Find non-repeating characters in a string 

Q4:You are given an array of integers. 
Write a C# program to find the frequency of each unique element in the array and 
store the results in a dictionary where the key is the element and the value is its frequency.
Then, print the elements and their frequencies.

Example:
Input:
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4 };

Output:
Element: 1, Frequency: 1
Element: 2, Frequency: 2
Element: 3, Frequency: 3
Element: 4, Frequency: 4
